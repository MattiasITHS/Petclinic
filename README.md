         Structure of the Github Repositary
 1. we created a repositary named Petclinic
 2. We cloned two repositaries(angular and rest) to our repositary and merged them in order to run the backend and frontend in Jenkins 
 3. we created branches for each team member and mangaged sending codes by using push and pull requests
 4. We are using our Github Url in Jenkins pipeline in order to fetch the codes from github
 5. we created a jenkins file and add all the stages to build api ,angular , robot and postman
 6. we created two folders named Tests and Results to keep all our Robot testcases in one folder and make it run in jenkins
 7. we added two files named postman collection and environment in order to run postman testcases
